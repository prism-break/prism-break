An MTA implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.</p><p>The terms mail server, mail exchanger, and MX host may also refer to a computer performing the MTA function. The Domain Name System (DNS) associates a mail server to a domain with mail exchanger (MX) resource records containing the domain name of a host providing MTA services.&rdquo;</p><footer>&mdash; <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent'>Wikipedia</a></cite></footer></blockquote>",

This is where you can help.</p><p>If you would like to support PRISM Break, please consider donating Bitcoin to fund future development. I suggest at least 0.005 BTC, but any amount is appreciated.
