Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.&rdquo;</p><footer>&mdash; <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP'>Wikipedia</a></cite></footer></blockquote>",

This is where you can help.</p><p>If you would like to support PRISM Break, please consider donating Bitcoin to fund future development. I suggest at least 0.005 BTC, but any amount is appreciated.
